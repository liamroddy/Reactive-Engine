# Reactive-Engine
An adventure game engine built with React.js

It's quite simple and elegant, but still allows for complex branching dialogue and player input.
It's also well commented and ideal to play around with for people inexperienced with React, or even Javascript itself.

If you want to dive right into making your own games with Reactive, without having to write any code at all, check out Scriptifier (https://github.com/liamroddy/Reactive-Scriptifier/), a tool for converting handwritten game scripts into Reactive Engine-compatible JSX files.
